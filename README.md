# 🎮 Text-Based Tic Tac Toe Game (Python)

A simple, interactive, terminal-based Tic Tac Toe game developed using Python.  
This project is ideal for beginners who want to understand fundamental programming concepts while building a classic game.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Tic Tac Toe is a two-player game where players take turns marking spaces in a 3×3 grid.  
The first player to align three of their symbols (`X` or `O`) horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game.

This implementation runs entirely in the terminal and focuses on clean logic, readability, and beginner-friendly structure.
