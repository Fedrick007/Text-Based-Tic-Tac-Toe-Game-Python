# 🎮 Text-Based Tic Tac Toe Game (Python)

A simple, interactive, terminal-based Tic Tac Toe game developed using Python.  
This project is ideal for beginners who want to understand fundamental programming concepts while building a classic game.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Tic Tac Toe is a two-player game where players take turns marking spaces in a 3×3 grid.  
The first player to align three of their symbols (`X` or `O`) horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game.

This implementation runs entirely in the terminal and focuses on clean logic, readability, and beginner-friendly structure.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Standard Python libraries only (no external dependencies)

---

## ✨ Features

- Two-player gameplay (Player X vs Player O)
- Clear text-based board display
- Input validation to prevent invalid moves
- Automatic win detection
- Draw detection when the board is full
- Clean and modular code using functions

---

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

- Lists and indexing
- Functions and modular programming
- Loops (`for`, `while`)
- Conditional statements
- Input handling and validation
- Generator expressions and logical evaluation
- Basic game logic implementation
